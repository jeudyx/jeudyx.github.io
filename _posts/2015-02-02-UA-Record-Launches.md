We recently unveiled [UA Record](https://record.underarmour.com), a comprehensive health and fitness network, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Built on the Under Armour Connected Fitness Platform, Record simplifies your personal health data with activity tracking tools, connects you to your digital community, and keeps you synced with your fitness goals 365, 24/7. This is the first digital product launch for Under Armour Connected Fitness and is available now for download on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/under-armour-women-i-will/id895425891?mt=8) and the [Google Play™ Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ua.record&hl=en).

UA Record offers everyone, regardless of fitness level, the ability to proactively manage their health and fitness through an open platform that’s personalized, easy to use and connected to their everyday lives. Features include GPS activity tracking from mobile sensors and third party devices, analysis from individual workouts and a total snapshot of your progress – including steps, sleep, caloric burn, heart rate, BMI and weight.

A new feature, Personal Challenges, has also been integrated into the UA Record app. Members can invite up to 19 friends within their network to compete in customized health and fitness challenges centered on specific goals. Challenges are based on workout count, total distance, total steps and calories burned. These daily, weekly, or monthly competitions provide real-time updates, leaderboard progress, and an open conversation forum for group participants.

Even more exciting are the features we added to our platform to build UA Record that we’re now opening up to all developers. You can find many new and updated API endpoints powering features found in UA Record, including:
